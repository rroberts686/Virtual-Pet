# Virtual Pets Re-Imagined
## Overview
Do you remember Cyberpet? Tamagotchi? Digimon? Petz? Virtual pets like these were born in 1996. With your help, they will be reborn. Virtual Toys, Inc. wants you to build the next iteration of virtual pets to market to adults who enjoy updated versions of the toys and games they played in their youth.  This game will be like the virtual pets of 1996...but so much more. It’s Virtual Pets Re-Imagined with your own personal touch!



## Welcome to the Dog the Bounty Hunter's Pet Shelter.

In this game, you have the ability to not only create your own pets, but also to interact with them and even make sure that they get to move on from your shelter (adoption). As time goes on, the pet statuses will be negatively affected by the passing of time (turns) that are displayed on the top of the console.

There are three main attributes to keep track of in this project (`Hunger`, `Boredom` and `Health`!)

To manage these attributes, you'll have the ability to feed your pets, play with your pets and take your pets to the doctor (mechanic for robots!) respectively. You can do so by either interacting with the entire group, or doing so on an individual basis. 

In the main menu, you'll see five main options to choose from

1.) Create a pet
	- This will allow you to create a new pet and specify whether you want them to be an organic pet or a robot. 
2.) View pet status
	- This selection will allow you to see all pet statuses in your shelter
3.) Interact with pet
	- This selection will allow you to interact with one pet in particular. (Play, feed, take to doctor) 
4.) Interact with group
	-This selection will allow you to interact with all pets at one time that are currently in your shelter. 
5.) Adoption
	-This selection will show all pets at your shelter, and allow you to remove them from your list.
